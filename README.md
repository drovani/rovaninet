# Rovani's Sandbox

This repository (and the various tools that are a part of GitHub) drives my personal website [rovani.net](https://rovani.net). It is a place for me to post commentary, lessons, tutorials, and generally anything I end up getting around to writing about.

I have many active side-projects for the site, too - though they are mostly way to apply lessons I'm trying to learn with various frameworks, libraries, languages, or other productivity tools.

# Hearthstone Mercenaries Helper

I started playing Hearthstone at launch and have mostly enjoyed playing the base collectable card game. Since then, I have passed on the Arena, Battlegrounds, and Duels game modes; but the Mercenaries mode has caught my interest. One of the first issues I ran into trying to remember which Mercenaries I was working on getting Tasks for, so that I could unlock certain equipment. This started as a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19FBZWszfu286zdRNZ43JvUD2bUvxLfrYTLmO1qSJmEM/edit?usp=sharing) and then expanded to where I had a fully formed project in my head. Now it is an actual [GitHub Project](https://github.com/drovani/rovaninet/projects/1) in this repo.

# Future Projects

- [ ] Implement site-wide authentication to allow for saved profiles, user data, etc.
- [ ] Rebuild HS Mercs Helper (and possibly other projects) in React, as a tool to learn that framework.
- [ ] Create a "Cash Rules" budget management tool to replace a complex, very manual, Google Sheet
