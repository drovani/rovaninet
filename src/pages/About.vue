    <h1>David Rovani - Résumé</h1>

    <h2>Passions and Motivators</h2>
    <p>Even before experience, proficiencies, or technical knowledge, I put forward my passions and motivators as the key to understanding why I excel at what I do. I love the thrill of solving difficult conundrums by conceptualizing unique and innovative solutions. I get excited about people who want to learn, grow, and be challenged; I want to be their teacher and mentor. I work hard to find the root causes of a problem, be it a failure of programming, processes, or people; and I stand out in my skills at finding the path toward continued and lasting success. Monotonous or repetitive tasks present their own challenges that motivate me to create automations and expose inefficiencies. Experimenting and exploring with new and creative technologies and products keeps me enthralled with the application development and developer operations space.</p>
    <p>I have built a reputation among my colleagues of trust and honesty, which affords me incredible leeway to pursue much of what I am passionate about. Throughout my career, I have stretched myself and my positions into greater challenges and areas of operation. I have spent years mentoring, teaching, and cultivating the next generation of developers, while still continuing to grow my own career in search of new opportunities. For these reasons, I think I will be an excellent fit for your organization’s current needs and future expansion.</p>

    <p>While I have been exclusively in a Microsoft environment for the last 10+ years professionally, I have started side projects over the years in various other technologies to get an idea of how they approach problems differently. Such projects include using Vue.js, Angular, Ruby on Rails, PHP on Zend framework, and VB on legacy ASP.NET.</p>

      <h3>
        Director of Information Services at
        <i>IFCJ</i>
      </h3>
      <span>November 2012 to October 2019</span>
    </header>
    <aside>The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ) is a global non-profit with offices in Chicago, Toronto, Brazil, South Korea, and Jerusalem providing humanitarian work in the eastern Mediterranean and former Soviet Union regions of the world. With annual revenue of $120m, IFCJ exists in an operational space with needs that reach into enterprise-level solutions, but within a budget designed to maximize stewardship of donors' contributions.</aside>
    <p>My time at The Fellowship was highlighted by moments of teaching and mentoring my team; growing and adapting the Information Services department to meet the ever changing needs of the company; and the ongoing work of maintaining and enhancing the custom built donor management system (KesherNet).</p>
    <p>Overseeing a team of 3 application developers, 2 database administrators, and a data hygienist, my role was both manager/mentor for the team and the senior technical resource. The department was responsible for ensuring that the organization has timely access to accurate data that is securely stored yet easily accessible. Information was retrieved from dozens of vendors through file imports, API calls, webhooks, and manual keying. The data was accessed by internal users through KesherNet, through custom reports, and shared with vendors through file exports.</p>
    <p>KesherNet is a web application written in C# on the ASP.NET and EF frameworks connecting to Microsoft SQL Server databases. It includes modules that handle payment processing (CC, ACH, and PayPal), fully templated receipt printing, weekly/monthly/quarterly (and other odd cadence) scheduled gifts, highly adaptable list segmentations, and many other custom tools that support business processes. I was the lead developer on the initial project to build the application, replacing a vendor’s legacy system that had reached its end-of-life. I continued to be the architect and lead developer while teaching and directing junior staff to take on more responsibilities as they learn and grow.</p>
    <p>Several later projects used an assortment of technologies and platforms, including Azure Functions, CosmosDb, App Services, and API Management to build a donation API for the publicly facing website; implemented code review and check-in policies and governance; and began creating the architecture of a fully cloud-native, open-source donor management solution to replace the current system.</p>
    <p>Initial position at IFCJ was as a Senior .NET Developer, then after a year was promoted to .NET Developer Team Lead. Two years later, promoted to Manager of Application Development. Received promotion to Director of Information Services in November 2017.</p>
