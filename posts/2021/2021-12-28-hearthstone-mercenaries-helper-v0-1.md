In an effort to get some in-depth experience with Vuejs and as a project to replace my Hearthstone Mercenaries Helper [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19FBZWszfu286zdRNZ43JvUD2bUvxLfrYTLmO1qSJmEM/edit?usp=sharing), I took the time to create an initial version of a suite of tools to aid in tracking mercenary progression in Hearthstone. Because my styling (this is applicable to most of my life, btw) is terribly basic, I pulled in Tailwind CSS for a bit of color and uniformity. I also later found that I needed to bring in a state tracker, so I learned a bit about Vuex.

My initial mistake is that I built it right into this blog site, when I really should have made it a standalone app, possibly with its own subdomain.
