As I watched the first two seasons of _The Mandalorian_, I had **_a lot_** of thoughts on the matter. Mostly that the show was derivative, loaded with tropes and cliches, monotonous in pacing, but with a stellar score. As _The Book of Boba Fett_ was being pitched, I had a feeling that I would also have Thoughts on the Matter. In the immortal words of Rick O'Connell, "here we go again."

> The first in a series of posts on ['My Thoughts on _TBoBF_'](/star-wars-commentary) and other _Star Wars_ series. A new thread after each season!

## Episode 1: Stranger in a Strange Series

- Talk about a bad case of heartburn.
- Wow... such original cinematogray, a hand shooting out of the ground! First off, the impracticality of being able to shove your arm past the elbow into the air without having disturbed any other part of the ground, especially with a big-ass helmet covering your dumb noggin'.
- I always thought the tiny t-shaped visor slot was just for show - that they actually had broad visibility in the helmet. But that shot tells me the Mandalorians really have shitty visibility.
- How can he have such perfectly white teeth having been malnourished, dehydrated, and nearly dead for... however long it's been. Even if this was just one day - there's no way he has a porcelain grill.
- It seems like we're being told that there are less-bad-guys (like his captors) and very-bad-guys (like these brigands that beat up a farmer and tagged his abode). Who are we rooting for again?
- If you're the crime boss, why do you think _anyone_ would keep their word; especially old bodyguards.
- I can't even describe how uninteresting this fight scene is... how do they manage to make it so boring?
- Space parkour ninjas! They're all the rage.
- I get pretty pissed off, too, when someone disturbs my slumber.
- A simple act of kindness always sparks another.

At first, I thought this episode was going to be tolerable; the longer it went on, it dipped into terrible. By the time the episode was over... well, [Drew Magary](https://www.sfgate.com/culture-columns/article/The-Book-Of-Boba-Fett-Premiere-Was-The-Worst-16738851.php) was much more eloquent about what an abysmal failure this episode was.

## Episode 2: The Trying Times of Carry About Tattooine

- Something that consistently bothers me about these wide shots is that shows the broad expanse of land around the characters; how small these travelers are compared to the openness around this enormous building. And yet, on the close-up shot, it looks like they just got off their speeder/wagon/horse and these last two miles of footsteps in-frame have been a leisurely stroll.
- Already really frikkin' predictable with the threaten-the-big-monster-haha-it's-not-really-there trope.
- Marching your prize through the square is a nice touch.
- Boba Fett has a (supposedly) internationally reknown assissin and two generic goblin guards, with seemingly no really support otherwise. Why does he seem to think he has a whole network of goons that'll back him in a power challenge? Clearly, I don't understand these power dynamics.
- "Bloodshed is bad for business." I need to find a way to work that into my next Ted talk.
- Those are some impressive sniper shots, moving on a train that quick, hitting prone humanoids, and missing very few shots.
- Now we're supposed to feel sorry for the dessert pirates because they are treating the protagonist well and one of the dead is a kid?
- Talk about a low risk bet: "wait, wait... so for the low cost of one rifle and one stick, you'll take out that train that just sniped several of our people? haha... ok, buddy. Best of luck!"
- The poor bartender/inn keeper: while these guys were assholes, they probably spent more money than they cost the place, and they were probably regular patrons. Now they're gonna be pissed off and take it out on the place.
- There has been no hit at why this train is bad, why it's so important to risk all these lives to stop it, or why I should care about this heist. Did the "Motivation?" card on the storyboard just disappear?
- Are we supposed to be drawing comparison to the "vision quest" trope, here? And did they just send a lizard up his nose, then let him wander off, tripping balls? What the actual fuck?
- How come he doesn't get a funky mask and other acoutrimonts?

It's a nice little touch to add some culture and sense of depth into the dessert raiders. This whole backstory part of the episode feels very _A Man Called Horse_ or _Dances with Wolves_.
