I just can't seem to manage consistently planning meals for two weeks in a row. This last week, however, was probably my best non-planned out week of meals. Several of the meals were either leftovers of meals or used the uncooked protein from meals from the prior week. For example, I did a pot roast stew on Tuesday night in the slow cooker using the portion of the beef that I didn't use from the Beef Stroganoff. Since we will be on vacation half of next week, I am going to be super ambitious and try to plan out 10 whole days of meals.  However, considering that I am writing this on Monday morning, I might have already made this a losing proposition.

|Day of Week| Breakfast         | Lunch                         | Dinner                      |

|Saturday  *| _on your own_     | ["Breaded" Paleo Chicken Cutlets][cutlets] | _dinner at parents' for March birthdays_ |
|Sunday     | _[Wishbone][wish]_ | _on your own_                | "Brinner" - pancakes, bacon, eggs |
|Monday     | Eggs & Tortillas  | Turkey Sandwich               | |
|Tuesday  **| M.Y.O. Oatmeal    |  | Slow Cooker Chili |
