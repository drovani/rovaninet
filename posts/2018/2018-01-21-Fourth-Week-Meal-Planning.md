After two weeks of solid meal planning, the third week got skipped entirely. Katie worked on Saturday and I was home on MLK, which meant that by the time my weekend was over, I was already thrown well off of a schedule. I never made time to do the meal planning and thus it didn't get done. Let that be the lesson for that weekend &ndash; whatever isn't made a priority doesn't get done. In order to keep these meal planning sessions going, I need to make it a priority. Even if that means it is prioritized over sleep. But here I am at 20:25, already starting to put together this upcoming week's meal plan.

Starting with "what's in the refrigerator", this week; I'm hoping that by listing out the perishables and proteins that I have on hand this week, it will inform me as to what I should cook.

- &frac12; a bag of broccoli - good for one meal, or two if combined with carrots
- 1&frac12; bags of carrots medley - there are my new favorite way to get variety into vegetables.
- 3 bell peppers (whole)
- 1&frac12; bell peppers (diced) - I diced up three of them, but used half of that for salad tonight
- Brussels sprouts - I have two bags uncut, and four meals worth chopped and in deli containers
- Salad greens - these expire quickly, so I need to used them all by Thursday's dinner

- Tortillas
- Hamburger buns
- English muffins

- Shrimp (in meat drawer)
- Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (frozen)
- Ground beef, 85&#37; lean (frozen, 1 lb. bags)
- Chicken thighs (frozen, 4 thighs per bag)
- Steak (frozen), probably filet mignons, individually wrapped
